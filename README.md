# Temperature Analysis

## Bukola Adeniyan, June 12, 2024

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the average high temperatures in New York City (NYC) from January 1895 to January 2018. By examining over a century of temperature data, we can identify long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and significant anomalies. The goal is to understand how temperatures have changed over time, assess the impact of climate change, and provide actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and the general public.

The analysis involves several key steps:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using statistical summaries and visualizations to explore the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to identify trends and patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building models to forecast future temperature trends.
- **Actionable Insights and Recommendations**: Providing data-driven insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset `ave_hi_nyc_jan_1895-2018.csv` contains the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the recorded temperature.
- **Temperature**: The average high temperature recorded in NYC.
- **Anomaly**: The temperature anomaly from the long-term average.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn

### Create Project

## Follow Steps to Complete Project

## Part 1 - Chart a Straight Line
Follow instructions from text [Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science](https://deitel.com/intro-to-python-for-computer-science-and-data-science/) on page 414, Chapter 10.16. Utilize markdown cells to create section headings as you work.  
 
## Part 2 - Prediction
Follow instructions from text [Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science](https://deitel.com/intro-to-python-for-computer-science-and-data-science/) on page 416, Chapter 10.16. Utilize markdown cells to create section headings as you work. You will create seven section while working through the data: 
- Section 1 - Data Acquisition
- Section 2 - Data Inspection
- Section 3 - Data Cleaning
- Section 4 - Descriptive Statistics
- Section 5 - Build the Model
- Section 6 - Predict
- Section 7 - Visualizations
It may be helpful to outline these headings in markdown cells, with code cells in between. 

## Part 3 - Prediction
Follow instructions from text [Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science](https://deitel.com/intro-to-python-for-computer-science-and-data-science/) on page 620, Chapter 15.4. Utilize markdown cells to create section headings as you work. From Part 2, you have already aquired, inspected, cleaned, and ran descriptive statistics on the data. You will do the following with the data in Part 3: 
- Section 1 - Build the Model
- Section 2 - Test the Model
- Section 3 - Predict 
- Section 3 - Visualizations
It may be helpful to outline these headings in markdown cells, with code cells in between. 

## Part 4 - Insights
Part 4 is a discussion of the two different methods use in this project to visualize data and find the linear regression line. 

## Part 5 - Bonus
Part 5 is continued practice of using machine learning, but with multiple linear regression. Follow instructions from text [Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science](https://deitel.com/intro-to-python-for-computer-science-and-data-science/) on page 624, Chapter 15.5. Utilize markdown cells to create section headings as you work. You will create seven section while working through the data: 
- Section 1 - Load Data
- Section 2 - Display Data 
- Section 3 - Explore Data with Pandas 
- Section 4 - Descriptive Statistics
- Section 5 - Visualize the Features 
- Section 6 - Splitting the Data for Training and Testing
- Section 7 - Training the Model
- Section 8 - Testing the Model
- Section 9 - Visualizing the Expected vs Predicted Prices
- Section 10 - Regression Model Metrics 
- Section 11 - Choosing the Best Model
It may be helpful to outline these headings in markdown cells, with code cells in between. 

## Project Summary
This is a professional project using Jupyter Lab following instructions from the textbook [Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science](https://deitel.com/intro-to-python-for-computer-science-and-data-science/). This project uses and compares statistical linear regression models and machine learning predictive abilities. There was additional content showing multiple linear regression models using machine learning.
